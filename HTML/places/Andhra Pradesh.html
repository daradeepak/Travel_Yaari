Being built on a 217km riverfront, the city is designed to have 51% of green spaces. Its foundation stone was laid on 22 October 2015 by prime Minister Narendra Modi. After the separation into two states in the year 2014, Hyderabad was declared the capital city of the then newly formed state Telangana.
It led to Amaravathi being chosen as the Capital of Andhra Pradesh. The word Amaravathi in itself was derived from the ancient capital of Satavahana dynasty. Pilgrims visit this town almost throughout the year owing to the number of temples and shrines that adorn the little town in different parts.

                        A little to the south of Palolem in Cancona region of Goa lies the Butterfly Beach. This beach, also known as Honeymoon Beach, is in the form of a small cove surrounded by dense trees. One of the most secluded and lesser-known beach of Goa, the butterfly
                        beach is mostly accessible by a boat (ferry) ride from the nearby beaches, which only adds to the charm.Vehicles do not lead directly to Butterfly Beach and reaching here through land involves a challenging forest hike. However,
                        this also makes for a wonderful opportunity to go trekking through a forest! Interestingly, Butterfly Beach is so named as the surrounding trees attract a wide variety of butterflies occasionally. It may also be because the beach
                        itself is in the shape of a butterfly! Either way, it is just as pretty as one, especially during sunsets.

                        The Rishikonda Beach also known as Rushikonda Beach is a stunning shore located on the coast of the Bay of Bengal in Vishakhapatnam, in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. APTDC, which is in charge of this natural beauty, has done a great job in the upkeep
                        of the beach and ensured that this natural attraction remains unspoilt. The Rishikonda Beach is thus rightly named as the 'Jewel of the East Coast', owing to its essential and intact beauty. The serene golden sands of the beach
                        are located in the bosom of the Rishikonda hill.

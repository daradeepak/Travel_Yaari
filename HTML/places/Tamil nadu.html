Bordered by the three seas - Arabian, Indian and the Bay of Bengal, Kanyakumari is the southernmost tip of Indian Peninsula. A small coastal town in the state of Tamil Nadu, Kanyakumari was earlier known as Cape Comorin. The town is a mountainous terrain amid three seas, with elevated patches of hills, coconut trees and lined with paddy fields. Kanyakumari is also the only place in India where you can observe the sunrise and sunset at the same beach. 
The town is not only popular for its unique phenomenon but also its beaches, temples, iconic monuments that attract a huge number of tourists throughout the year. The Kanyakumari Temple, Vivekananda Rock Memorial, Statue of the Poet Thiruvalluvar, the Padmanabhapuram Palace, the Vattakottai Fort, and the Gandhi Memorial are few of the most important sites in Kanyakumari. 
Waterfalls in Kanyakumari that you should not miss out on include the Thirparappu falls, the Courtallam Falls, and the Olakaruvi falls. Kanyakumari has an authentic South Indian cuisine, with seafood and coconuts being an integral part of almost all dishes. While Kanyakumari is not a traditional shopping destination, you can buy plenty of souvenirs and curios from the numerous stalls and boutiques dotting the beachfront, with decorative seashell trinkets being a must-buy.

 Widely known for its beautiful 'Kanchipuram sarees' and also referred to as the 'golden city of a thousand temples', Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu is a popular tourist attraction. Kanchipuram or Kanchi attracts a lot of tourists from all over the world who are interested in Hinduism or just want to enjoy the marvel of South Indian architecture and grandeur. 
It is particularly known for being a culture and philosophical hub. With such an association being made with the city, it is only natural that this destination has become such an influential centre in these avant-garde times. The city is home to the famous Kanchi Kamakshi Temple, which is the highly revered abode of Kamakshi (Goddess Parvathi) - consort of Lord Shiva. The Kailasanathar Temple is also popular and is known for its magnificent architecture. The highest, largest and most impressive temple in the town, spanning 40 acres and dating back to the Pallava period is the Ekambeshwarar Temple. The Kanchi Mutt holds kutcheris or South Indian classical music concerts in the evenings.

Madurai, the cultural capital of Tamil Nadu, is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities of India. Ruled by Pandya kings for the longest time in its history, it is called as the 'Lotus City' as it was planned and built in the shape of a lotus. Madurai is known for Meenakshi Amman Temple, dedicated to the goddess Meenakshi with a sanctum for her consort, Sundareshwarar. 
There are many other ancient temples in Madurai, including Thiruparankundram. It is one of the important old temples dedicated to Lord Muruga(Karthikeya) and is located on a hillock approximately 8 km from the city. Having trade ties with ancient Rome, the place holds a great cultural heritage. With bustling bazaars and fantastic street food, Madurai has heritage walks conducted throughout the day. Madurai is instrumental in promoting Tamil language and preserving the culture.
